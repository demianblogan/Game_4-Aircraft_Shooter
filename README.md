# Game_4-Aircraft_Shooter
About This is my 4th game for my portfolio. This project is written on C++ with SFML. It's an aircraft shooter with the camera above the player. You can control an airship, shoot enemies with two different kinds of projectiles, collect pickups and finish the level. The game has a title screen, main menu, settings menu, and pause menu.
